### TODO

1. Track state on the server (right now, for the 'server toggle' buttons) so data will persist between clients across page refreshes.
2. Remove raw DOM manipulations and implement a framework on the front-end; Angular 2, Vue, or React. We can also look more into Meteor.
3. Implement webpack as a module loader to simplify project dependencies
4. Modularize the app.js file and separate concerns
